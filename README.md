# Person tracking and re-ID with multi-view streaming

## Introduction

This repository has been established to manage a series of activities aimed at developing a video processing model for synchronizing and tracking individuals captured on multi-camera setups.

The project deadline is **October 30th**, and the immediate plan is to construct the model by merging the Re-Identification (re-ID) model OSNet-AIN with the object tracking model DeepSORT. However, for efficient progress, the utilization of a reference model that concurrently considers re-ID and tracking may be required. In such cases, we will investigate benchmark datasets and models for this purpose through channels like [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=person-re-identification).

Documentation updates will adhere to the principle of creating or modifying files within the `/Docs` folder. However, if there are clear development milestones and deployment plans, this README will be updated to reflect those details.
